# Enhanced-WGAN-based-Class-Balancing-Strategy-for-E-Wallets-and-Credit-Card-Transactions-Dataset

**Effectiveness of Class Balancing Strategies in E-Wallets and Credit Card Transactions**

This project explores advanced methods for addressing the class imbalance problem in financial datasets, with a focus on e-wallet and credit card fraud detection. We propose an enhanced **Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN)** incorporating **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** layers to generate realistic synthetic data, enabling more robust fraud detection models. The project includes:

- **Graph-based Data Representation**: Transforming tabular datasets into graph structures to capture intricate relationships between transactions.
- **Novel Enhanced WGAN Framework**: Utilizing GCN layers within WGAN architecture for synthetic data generation to balance datasets effectively.
- **Benchmarking Traditional Methods**: Comparing performance against resampling techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN), cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble methods.
- **Comprehensive Metrics Analysis**: Evaluating models with precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, MCC, and other metrics to demonstrate improved sensitivity and robustness.

The project is implemented using Python and demonstrates a scalable, innovative approach to mitigating class imbalance in financial fraud detection. Experimental results validate the proposed method's superiority over traditional and GAN-based solutions in real-world financial datasets.
